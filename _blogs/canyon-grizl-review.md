The Cayon Grizl CF CL is Canyons entry level carbon "Adventure" gravel bike, in contrast to the Grail which is race oriented bike. The "Adventure" monicker means that the bikes geometry is less aggressive, the frame is packed with mounting points for bags racks and other accessories and it comes equipped with a dropper post from the factory.
